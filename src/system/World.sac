 * The global object TheWorld of class World serves as a representation of the
 * execution environment. It provides access to resources residing outside the
 * functional framework of a SAC program.
 *
 * In order to allow concurrent access to unrelated parts of the execution
 * environment, some other predefined global objects are derived from world
 * upon program start. These represent disjoint partitions of the execution
 * environment or outside world.
 *
 * These are:
 *  - TheTerminal
 *  - TheFileSys
 *  - TheEnvironment
 *  - TheCommandLine
 *  - TheClock
